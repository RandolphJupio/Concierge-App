I called today and they said that they couldn't deliver until an hour and a half from order time, because they didn't have delivery drivers. ** that! I'm paying for the convenience of delivery... And tipping! You are less than a mile from me. Yet want to charge delivery fees, but it will take an hour and a half? ** that! Don't offer delivery...

I called several times to the store just to be told that it is an error on the program's estimated time. When I requested more information regarding this error, the sales attendant couldn't provide with a contact information. I asked to speak with the manager to see if he could explain better what was happening to my order. He then decides to be disrespectfully and treat me like a child. As I was explaining the situation, I was interrupted to be asked, 'How did the pizza taste?' I wouldn't know, I hadn't received them. More important not only did he failed to appeased a customer and offer an apology, he had to asked around for the regional manager last name. Anyhow, this is their third and last strike, they just lost another customer."

Called back and order not in the system so 15 minutes later and order was finally in the system. My problem is this is not Real Customer service. A third party shouldn't be involved in my order process. When I call that store and place order I want to talk to the person directly responsible for my food. So if my order is wrong I can then call the store directly for my complaint. These type of third party calling is another thing wrong with this once great country."

Where else would we go and get such good service? This is the only store or business I have ever known up in the 50 years of my life that delivers pizza on foot to the nearby businesses extremely fast most of the time within 7 minutes. This is quite a shame that this is happening. This business was doing fine. How much do you need for a business to keep going? I look out my window all the time at the store here at Cartridge World and see them at the window studying delivering pizzas. But yeah you want to close this very important store. Pizza Hut please hear my request to leave the store open.I'm just one person in this whole community and I hope you hear me out because if you need the whole Community we can work that out too. We need the store. Can you give it a chance? Summers coming the business will pick up. If you think its not doing good I assure you we need this business in this strip mall and for the surrounding areas.",

Their staff are also very very warm and accommodating. However, I couldn't give their pizza the thumbs up. Over the years, the dough has become dry and oily. Their toppings dry and lacking. You will enjoy the pizza a bit if you eat it right there in the restaurant but once you eat it later, it tastes stale and plain. Their pasta also tastes uncooked and hard at times, and though I love their soup recipes, more often than not it taste burnt. They should really look into what they are doing wrong. I have loved Pizza Hut more than our local pizza place before but not anymore. I am still satisfied with them but I do not wish to be only satisfied. I only dine out once in a while and so if I dine out I wish it to be a HAPPY experience.Were you able to take a picture?",

Back then their pizza was actually really good, and I always looked forward to eating there during special occasions. Now they have all these affordable promos and more people are eating there, and it has led to a decrease in quality of their food. Sometimes there are barely enough toppings, sometimes even the soup isn't hot, and the servers all seem too busy to pay any attention. I miss the Pizza Hut during my childhood when eating there was always a special time. Now it just seems like any other cheap pizza joint. What a shame. It used to be that when I thought of great pizza, Pizza Hut came to mind first. Now I only think about them when I want to eat cheap good-enough pizza that looks premium, even though it's not."

When I get to the Domino's on 941 S General McMullen Dr San Antonio, TX 78237 They tell me that 1 of the 2 pizza I order online was not made and that they would make right away and it would about 15 min's. I ask for them to redo both pizza cause I like 2 fresh pizza not 1 that would be 15 min's old. After 20 mins I ask about my pizzas and again they said there was a mistake made and would remake them again.I was getting frustrated and the manager said he would give me some cheesy bread if I would stop having a bad attitude. I a 55 year old man.I don't appreciate a kid manager accusing me of having a bad attitude after they mess up twice. 15 mins later they only remade one so I ended up with one crispy pizza and one soggy pizza that was 15 min old. The manager ignored me after that and they overcharge me and I had to get that fixed. Terrible experience.",

The online status showed my order was confirmed and the order was being processed. The order showed that I should expect a 52-62 minute delivery time. After an hour and twenty minutes, I called the store to check on the progress of my order. I was told 'Oh, we cancelled your order, we were really busy about that time.' I could not believe the cavalier tone of the person I was speaking to. I asked 'why was I not informed of this?', and was told 'That's a good question.' There was no sense of embarrassment. There was no offer to correct the issue, or rush a replacement order to me. In fact I was told that if I wanted to re - order they would not be able to expedite the process at all.It seems that cancelling orders is part of normal practice for this Domino's. By this time it was after 10 pm, and there were no other options to order out. I enjoyed a meal of leftovers that night. This was a Domino's in Indianapolis, IN.I gave this review 2 stars, as maybe Domino's has implemented a new diet program to help customer lose weight by canceling their orders. If that was the case, it was effective."
